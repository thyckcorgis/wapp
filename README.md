## Inspiration
Originating from our own bad habits, drinking water has been an important but often forgotten part of our lives. With COVID-19, masks have prevented workers from remembering to take water breaks. We thought, maybe we could help these people. Maybe all they needed was a WApp.

## What it does
WApp is very simple. You can get a taste of our WApp in 3 easy steps:
1. You get thirsty.
2. Drink water and log your water intake.
3. ComPEEte with your friends by reaching your daily goal!

## How we built it
We used React Native for cross-platform mobile development. Next, we used routes to connect components to each other so friends could connect between accounts.

## Challenges we ran into
We didn't sleep. Now we're really tired. :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Since this is our second Hackathon, we're very proud of accomplishing a fully-functional app with the major features we set out to achieve.

## What we learned
We learned how to better style and structure a mobile app.

## What's next for WApp
We're definitely going to use WApp for our day to day lives.
