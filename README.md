## Inspiration
Originating from our own bad habits, drinking water has been an important but often forgotten part of our lives. With COVID-19, masks have prevented workers from remembering to take water breaks. We thought, maybe we could help these people. Maybe all they needed was WApp.

## What it does
WApp is very simple. You can get a taste of our WApp in 3 easy steps:
1. You get thirsty.
2. Drink water and log your water intake.
3. ComPEEte with your friends by reaching your daily goal!

## How we built it
We used React Native for cross-platform mobile development. Next, we used a REST API with NodeJS and Express so friends could connect between accounts. Lastly, we used Expo push notifications for reminders and friend requests.

## Challenges we ran into
All this talk about WApp made us thirsty ;) We didn't drink 1 drop of water. Now we're really dry ;P

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Since this is our second Hackathon, we're very proud of accomplishing a fully-functional app with the major features we set out to achieve. We're immensely proud of providing our WApp to the world. 

## What we learned
We learned how to better style and structure a mobile app. Also, we learned how to divide our tasks better to quickly get tasks done.

## What's next for WApp
In the future, we're going to implement the calendar function so it can give you a history of your water intake habits. You can also compare trends and we can have more fun tips as well. Personally, we're going to use WApp for our day to day lives. Everyone's gonna want to have a WApp.
